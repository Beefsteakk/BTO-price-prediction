## Overview
This project aims to predict the maximum selling prices of HDB BTO flats based on features such as flat type, location, and year. Using a linear regression model, I achieved an RÂ² score of 74.6% and a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 68,975 SGD.
## Features
- Data cleaning - removed missing values, NaN, and duplicate data.
- Employed a Linear Regression Model using Scikit-learn.
- Used one-hot encoding for categorical data.
